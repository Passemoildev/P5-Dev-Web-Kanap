This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.
You will also need to install express to run the server.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

#### How it works

Then you can command.
Just enter your information in the formulary (with data verification).
All the datas are saved in the local storage.
Then you're on your cart. Once you validate it, you've finally ordered your sofas. Congrats !
